# SimpleMidiToPDFConverter
A Simple Midi to PDF Converter with a easy GUI
Needs the "LilyPond" folder in the same directory in order to function.
Currently very poorly converts midi to pdfs as lilypond does not do a good job on anything that is not STRICTLY Computer generated (ie work from the python library "MIDIFile" where it actually works pretty good)

TODO abandon LilyPond
