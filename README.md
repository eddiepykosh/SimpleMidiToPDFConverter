# SimpleMidiToPDFConverter
A Simple Midi to PDF Converter with a easy GUI

Needs the "LilyPond" folder in the same directory in order to function.

TODO abandon LilyPond

Probably will crash because of missing Python Libraries but god if I know what those libraries are.  (If you install LilyPond or have LilyPond installed you'll probably be fine)
